## Overview

This is my solution to the stat-preview-card-component project. I used vanilla HTML and CSS. It details 3 different types of cars, and each section is colored differently.

## My process

Building this project, I started by creating a div to hold all content. Then, I created 3 additional divs to separate each section of content. I used divs to display the content in a flexbox and make the page responsive. 

### Built with

- Semantic HTML5 markup
- CSS custom properties
- Flexbox
- CSS Grid
- Google Fonts

### What I learned

This project taught me how to divide the contents of a webpage and improve my creation process. It showed how to take one section at a time and finish it before moving on. I also learned how to utilize flexbox for mobile and desktop devices.

### Continued development

I will continue to use the fundamental concepts that I learned from this project and apply them to other projects from frontendmentor.io
